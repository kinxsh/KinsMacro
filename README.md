# KinsMacro
A simple alternative to DolphSols Macro (https://github.com/BuilderDolphin/dolphSol-Macro/releases)
I got inspired to make this from dolph sols macro so go check it out! I decided to make this due to a annoying issue with camera alignment having very poor reliability
and causing it to mess up the macro, this aims to fix it.
Pros:
- More reliable
Cons:
- Less efficient paths (due to no camera alignment)
- VIP only ( Will make non-vip version soon!)
- Less features (Only finds paths, no auto reconnect or aura screenshots. Coming soon)
- This is not as good compared to dolph sols macro but if you find constant issues with camera alignment please give it a try!

If you really care about features or you don't have issues with camera alignment, trust me, use dolph sols macro.

Roadmap (Highest to lowest priority)
- Add Auto reconnect
- Add Non-VIP paths
- Add aura screenshots
- Optimize reliability and paths more
