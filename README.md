# KinsMacro
A simple alternative to DolphSols Macro (https://github.com/BuilderDolphin/dolphSol-Macro/releases)
I got inspired to make this from dolph sols macro so go check it out! I decided to make this due to a annoying issue with camera alignment having very poor reliability
and causing it to mess up the macro, this aims to fix it.

`
Pros:
More reliable
Cons:
Less efficient paths (due to no camera alignment)
VIP only ( Will make non-vip version soon!)
Less features (Only finds paths, no auto reconnect or aura screenshots. Coming soon)
This is not as good compared to dolph sols macro but if you find constant issues with camera alignment please give it a try!
If you really care about features or you don't have issues with camera alignment, trust me, use dolph sols macro.

Roadmap (Highest to lowest priority)
- Add Auto reconnect
- Add Non-VIP paths
- Add aura screenshots
- Optimize reliability and paths more
